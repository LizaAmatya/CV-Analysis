Full Stack Web Developer

Fair Lawn, NJ - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/Abu-Bah/375bbc630a04be46

Highly focused and driven individual, always seeking out developing trends and technologies. I love what I
do and sometimes it feels as if I've never worked a day in my life - true story. Writing code, like poetry, is an
art form and I really enjoy it.

Currently I work as a full stack web developer, leveraging open source technologies to create and maintain
flexible,  scalable,  and  reliable  web  applications  reaching  millions  of  users  per  year.  I  work  on  front-end
applications  utilizing  core  web  technologies  (HTML,  JavaScript,  CSS)  as  well  as  back-end  design  and
implementation  (PHP,  ASP,  MySQL,  Apache)  -  producing  modular,  efficient  object-oriented  code.  I  have
foundational knowledge of C++, but have primarily focused on PHP-based web services and APIs. 

I possess the necessary skills to approach nearly any situation with the confidence and knowledge to get the
job done, on time and on budget.
