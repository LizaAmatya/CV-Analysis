So the system we are making measures the temperature, heart rate and tracks the\nlocation of the livestock and send the corresponding data to the web page. The webpage we are making comprises of\naccess to veterinary and livestock owner so that they can know about the cattle condition and track the location of it.\nWhenever the vet wants to send any recommendation(like medicines) to the owner for taking care of the livestock he can\n\nAdarsh Ghimire\n\n2\n\n\fsend the recommendation on web or through the use of GSM technology which we provide to vet. And the whenever the\nlocation of livestock is needed by the owner, he can send the alert through his cell phone or the web then the\ncorresponding location of cattle is send directly sent to owner cell phone through the GPS and GSM technology which we\nwill be embedding in that system.\n\nAwards and Honours\n\nWinner of \"Idea Hunt\"  IT MEET 2018, Kathmandu University Computer Club(KUCC) on January 5th and 6th,\n2018.\n\nCertified by Japan International Cooperation Center for completion of \"JENESYS 2016 SAARC 1st batch\"\nfrom Jan 16 to Jan 24, 2017\n\nHonoured with Best Presentation (NEPAL) among all SAARC countries in JENESYS 2016 program by the\nPakistani Ambassador.\n\nSelected by Nepal Government for \"Training in Telecommunication\" In Japan as a part of \"JENESYS 2016\"\nFirst batch.\n\nAppreciated for volunteering in OKRP(Office of Kathmandu Engineering College Research and\nPublications) conference 2017.\n\n Third position in  Yantra(International Robotics Competition) \"Manual Akhada\" held on 30th of November\n2016.\n\nThird position in \"ROBODRIFT 4.0\" organized by Robotics Club of Kathmandu Engineering College on 30th\nof July 2016.\n\n Outstanding participation in \"International Yoga day\" on 21st June, 2015 at Kathmandu Engineering\nCollege.\n\nSkills\nCCNA,Python, JUPYTER notebook,MATLAB, Arduino Programming, C, C++, Drone making.\n\nOngoing learning:\nCCNP\n\nInvolvement\n\n1.
