Description 
It is an easy to use web application to create, design, assign and analyze online assessments. Creating a 
test is just a click of button away. When you click on create test, system will create a predefined test 
based on standard test settings. But If you need to customize then everything is simple and is effective 
right away. 
 
When you finish adding all questions to your test, you can start inviting candidates right away. You can 
either make your exam public or private. If the exam is public then users can access it right away but if 
it’s private then the system will just email your candidates from the system.
