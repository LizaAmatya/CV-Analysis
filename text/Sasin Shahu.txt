Language of Implementation:           Arduino
Operating System:      Windows 98/7/8.
DESCRIPTION:         This embedded system project was based on Arduino. It can be 
used to control hardware like motor, buzzer or lights using the voice of the user. It 
can  be  used  to  eliminate  the  need  of  switches.  The  user  can  control  the  devices 
without the need of approaching the devices. 

Project2:         Wireless Surveillance and Monitoring System 
Language of Implementation:           JAVA
Operating System:      Android
DESCRIPTION:         It is a JAVA based project to implement remote surveillance and 
monitoring  system.  It  can  be  used  to  monitor  the  property  by  the  use  of  GSM 
network. It is implemented by making a video call to the camera. The camera sends 
the live feed back to the user enabling the user to record the video too. The user can 
control the camera with the help of keypad and execute rotate functions and zoom 
function.
