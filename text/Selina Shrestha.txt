PROJECTS 

·  Child Health Tracker (Minor Project) [2017] 

The project consists of a prototype of a wearable health tracker for children that continuously tracks the 
temperature and heart rate of the child and allows the values to be stored in the parent’s android device via 
Bluetooth. Any anomalies in the measurements are immediately put under spotlight by notifying the 
parent’s device. During the project, I worked with the sensors’ specifications, error minimization and 
towards building an android application that would show the temperature and heart rate values received 
and send a notification whenever the values were abnormal.
