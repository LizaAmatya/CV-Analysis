Job Objective 

To be able to grow personally and professionally in the computer engineering field along with the 
growth of the company itself. 

 

Personal View 

As a fresh graduate, I understand I am yet to learn a lot of things to get recognition as a computer 
engineer. So far, the academic life has been going good and I am always successful to showcase 
my knowledge by understanding and implementing the taught materials. I wish to continue to do 
the same in my internship too. I shall not give up or feel stress over the job given to me. As it is a 
learning and growing opportunity for me, I vow to give my 100% throughout the period to become 
a quality engineer and not let the company name ruin on my behalf.
